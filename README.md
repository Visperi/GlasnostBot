## telegram.py

An asynchronous python library for telegram API.

This is a very young and Work In Progress project. Even the name is subject to change. 
Lots of functionality (basically all) is still missing, and documentation is nonexistent, 
although the structure and classes are solely based on the official API documentation. 
Just converted to use pythonic coding style.  

**Python 3.8 or higher is required**
