## telegram.py

A python library for telegram API.

This is a very young and Work In Progress project. Lots of functionality is still missing, and documentation is 
nonexistent, although it is solely based on the official API documentation. 
Just converted to use pythonic coding style. 

**Python 3.8 or higher is required**
